# Angular2-Connectivity
In this section you will learn of how to build forms and validations. In Angular, there are 2 types of forms : Template-Driven and
Model-Driven Forms.

The Template-Driven is easier to implement but it's limited to the validation. In other hand, the Model-Driven requires more code but you have full control over validation.
Most of the samples are from the course [Angular 2 with TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-tutorial-for-beginners/learn/v4/overview) by Mosh Hamedi on Udemy.
I'm developping the Angular 2 samples along way I'm learning Angular 2. If you have time, I recommend you to take the course because it has richer contents.
